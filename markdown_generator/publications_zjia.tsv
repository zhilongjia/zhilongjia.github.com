2011-02-01	A genetically synthetic protein-based cationic polymer for siRNA delivery	Medical Hypotheses	"In recent years, a large number of researchers have paid much attention on small interfering RNA (siRNA) after the advent of RNA interference technology, which has been harnessed as an efficient way of sequence-specific gene silencing in gene therapy, enables elucidation of gene functions, and the identification of new drug targets. Despite tremendous progress has been made in novel delivery systems and vectors via formulation of polyplexes and conjugations, such as cationic polymers (LPEI, BPEI), cationic liposome (DOTAP), peptides (CPP), unmet needs still exist. Many cationic agents used for condensing siRNA often exhibits severe cytotoxicity, which limits clinical applications, and is obliged to be handled. Thus great interest in searching for novel and sophisticated polymeric vectors has been spurred. Herein we proposed a genetically synthetic protein-based polymer, which is also referred to as elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) excerpted from human tropoelastin highly repetitive sequence, Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly, where the “guest residue” Xaa is any amino acid except Pro. Thus, if we alternate the “guest residue” Xaa to Lys or Arg, to a significant extent, it can emerge as a powerful cationic polymer for siRNA delivery carrier, and hopefully it will be put into practice in the near future."

2013-01-01	Application of ribosome profiling	Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics	"The ribosome profiling, based on deep sequencing of the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, makes it possible to deeply and precisely study genome-wide protein translation process and translation regulation. This review introduces the development, construction and analysis of the ribosome profiling, and focuses on its wide applications. These applications include discovering novel ORFs (such as uORF and sORF), deciphering the mechanism of microRNA functional roles, charactering the translation efficiency and differential translation, predicting the protein abundance and illustrating the mechanism of protein translation. Finally, we analyze the broad development prospect of ribosome profiling. http://www.pibb.ac.cn/pibbcn/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=20120395&flag=1"	"Jia, Z.L., Qu, W.B., Lu, Y.M., Luo, Z.G., & Zhang, C.G.

2015-09-08	Gene Ranking of RNA-Seq Data via Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization	PLos One	"RNA-sequencing is rapidly becoming the method of choice for studying the full complexity of transcriptomes, however with increasing dimensionality, accurate gene ranking is becoming increasingly challenging. This paper proposes an accurate and sensitive gene ranking method that implements discriminant non-negative matrix factorization (DNMF) for RNA-seq data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the utility of DNMF for gene ranking. When incorporating Fisher's discriminant criteria and setting the reduced dimension as two, DNMF learns two factors to approximate the original gene expression data, abstracting the up-regulated or down-regulated metagene by using the sample label information. The first factor denotes all the genes' weights of two metagenes as the additive combination of all genes, while the second learned factor represents the expression values of two metagenes. In the gene ranking stage, all the genes are ranked as a descending sequence according to the differential values of the metagene weights. Leveraging the nature of NMF and Fisher's criterion, DNMF can robustly boost the gene ranking performance. The Area Under the Curve analysis of differential expression analysis on two benchmarking tests of four RNA-seq data sets with similar phenotypes showed that our proposed DNMF-based gene ranking method outperforms other widely used methods. Moreover, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also showed DNMF outweighs others. DNMF is also computationally efficient, substantially outperforming all other benchmarked methods. Consequently, we suggest DNMF is an effective method for the analysis of differential gene expression and gene ranking for RNA-seq data."

2015-09-22	Semi-Supervised Projective Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Cancer Classification	PLos One	"Advances in DNA microarray technologies have made gene expression profiles a significant candidate in identifying different types of cancers. Traditional learning-based cancer identification methods utilize labeled samples to train a classifier, but they are inconvenient for practical application because labels are quite expensive in the clinical cancer research community. This paper proposes a semi-supervised projective non-negative matrix factorization method (Semi-PNMF) to learn an effective classifier from both labeled and unlabeled samples, thus boosting subsequent cancer classification performance. In particular, Semi-PNMF jointly learns a non-negative subspace from concatenated labeled and unlabeled samples and indicates classes by the positions of the maximum entries of their coefficients. Because Semi-PNMF incorporates statistical information from the large volume of unlabeled samples in the learned subspace, it can learn more representative subspaces and boost classification performance. We developed a multiplicative update rule (MUR) to optimize Semi-PNMF and proved its convergence. The experimental results of cancer classification for two multiclass cancer gene expression profile datasets show that Semi-PNMF outperforms the representative methods."

We sequenced the exomes of 3222 British adults of Pakistani heritage with high parental relatedness, discovering 1111 rare-variant homozygous genotypes with predicted loss of function (knockouts) in 781 genes. We observed 13.7% fewer homozygous knockout genotypes than we expected, implying an average load of 1.6 recessive-lethal-equivalent loss-of-function (LOF) variants per adult. When genetic data were linked to the individuals’ lifelong health records, we observed no significant relationship between gene knockouts and clinical consultation or prescription rate. In this data set, we identified a healthy PRDM9-knockout mother and performed phased genome sequencing on her, her child, and control individuals. Our results show that meiotic recombination sites are localized away from PRDM9-dependent hotspots. Thus, natural LOF variants inform on essential genetic loci and demonstrate PRDM9 redundancy in humans."

2016-05-27	"Cogena, a novel tool for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis, applied to drug repositioning and drug mode of action discovery"	BMC Genomics	"Drug repositioning, finding new indications for existing drugs, has gained much recent attention as a potentially efficient and economical strategy for accelerating new therapies into the clinic. Although improvement in the sensitivity of computational drug repositioning methods has identified numerous credible repositioning opportunities, few have been progressed. Arguably the “black box” nature of drug action in a new indication is one of the main blocks to progression, highlighting the need for methods that inform on the broader target mechanism in the disease context.
We demonstrate that the analysis of co-expressed genes may be a critical first step towards illumination of both disease pathology and mode of drug action. We achieve this using a novel framework, co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis (cogena) for co-expression analysis of gene expression signatures and gene set enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes. The cogena framework enables simultaneous, pathway driven, disease and drug repositioning analysis. Cogena can be used to illuminate coordinated changes within disease transcriptomes and identify drugs acting mechanistically within this framework. We illustrate this using a psoriatic skin transcriptome, as an exemplar, and recover two widely used Psoriasis drugs (Methotrexate and Ciclosporin) with distinct modes of action. Cogena out-performs the results of Connectivity Map and NFFinder webservers in similar disease transcriptome analyses. Furthermore, we investigated the literature support for the other top-ranked compounds to treat psoriasis and showed how the outputs of cogena analysis can contribute new insight to support the progression of drugs into the clinic. We have made cogena freely available within Bioconductor or https://github.com/zhilongjia/cogena.
In conclusion, by targeting co-expressed genes within disease transcriptomes, cogena offers novel biological insight, which can be effectively harnessed for drug discovery and repositioning, allowing the grouping and prioritisation of drug repositioning candidates on the basis of putative mode of action."

This study represents direct evidences that high expression of CPT1A is significantly associated with poor outcomes and abnormal genomic and epigenomic patterns in AML patients. CPT1A is an important catalyzer for fatty-acid oxidation pathway, which may provide alternative carbon source for leukemia proliferation. Findings of this study may indicate the significance of fat metabolism in leukemogenesis."	"Shi, J., Fu, H., Jia, Z., He, K., Fu, L., & Wang, W. (2016).

2017-10-10	The biological impact of blood pressure-associated genetic variants in the natriuretic peptide receptor C gene on human vascular smooth muscle	Human Molecular Genetics	"Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major global risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic variants at the NPR3 locus associated with BP, but the functional impact of these variants remains to be determined. Here we confirmed, by a genome-wide association study within UK Biobank, the existence of two independent BP-related signals within NPR3 locus. Using human primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) from different individuals, we found that the BP-elevating alleles within one linkage disequilibrium block identified by the sentinel variant rs1173771 was associated with lower endogenous NPR3 mRNA and protein levels in VSMCs, together with reduced levels in open chromatin and nuclear protein binding. The BP-elevating alleles also increased VSMC proliferation, angiotensin II-induced calcium flux and cell contraction. However, an analogous genotype-dependent association was not observed in vascular ECs. Our study identifies novel, putative mechanisms for BP-associated variants at the NPR3 locus to elevate BP, further strengthening the case for targeting NPR-C as a therapeutic approach for hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention."

2019-04-09	Transcriptional profiling in the livers of rats after hypobaric hypoxia exposure	PeerJ	"Ascent to high altitude feels uncomfortable in part because of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen due to the decrease in barometric pressure. The molecular mechanisms causing injury in liver tissue after exposure to a hypoxic environment are widely unknown. The liver must physiologically and metabolically change to improve tolerance to altitude-induced hypoxia. Since the liver is the largest metabolic organ and regulates many physiological and metabolic processes, it plays an important part in high altitude adaptation. The cellular response to hypoxia results in changes in the gene expression profile. The present study explores these changes in a rat model. To comprehensively investigate the gene expression and physiological changes under hypobaric hypoxia, we used genome-wide transcription profiling. Little is known about the genome-wide transcriptional response to acute and chronic hypobaric hypoxia in the livers of rats. In this study, we carried out RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of liver tissue from rats in three groups, normal control rats (L), rats exposed to acute hypobaric hypoxia for 2 weeks (W2L) and rats chronically exposed to hypobaric hypoxia for 4 weeks (W4L), to explore the transcriptional profile of acute and chronic mountain sickness in a mammal under a controlled time-course. We identified 497 differentially expressed genes between the three groups. A principal component analysis revealed large differences between the acute and chronic hypobaric hypoxia groups compared with the control group. Several immune-related and metabolic pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and galactose metabolism, were highly enriched in the KEGG pathway analysis. Similar results were found in the Gene Ontology analysis. Cogena analysis showed that the immune-related pathways were mainly upregulated and enriched in the acute hypobaric hypoxia group."

2019-09-20	Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis for Drug Repositioning in Fusobacterium nucleatum-Infected Human Gingival Fibroblasts.	Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology	"Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is a crucial periodontal pathogen and human gingival fibroblasts (GFs) are the first line of defense against oral pathogens. However, the research on potential molecular mechanisms of host defense and effective treatment of F. nucleatum infection in GFs remains scarce. In this study, we undertook a time-series experiment and performed an RNA-seq analysis to explore gene expression profiles during the process of F. nucleatum infection in GFs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) could be divided into three coexpression clusters. Functional analysis revealed that the immune-related signaling pathways were more overrepresented at the early stage, while metabolic pathways were mainly enriched at the late stage. We computationally identified several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that could protect the F. nucleatum infected GFs via a coexpression-based drug repositioning approach. Biologically, we confirmed that six drugs (etravirine, zalcitabine, wortmannin, calcium D-pantothenate, ellipticine, and tanespimycin) could significantly decrease F. nucleatum-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and block the Protein Kinase B (PKB/AKT)/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Our study provides more detailed molecular mechanisms of the process by which F. nucleatum infects GFs and illustrates the value of the cogena-based drug repositioning method and the potential therapeutic application of these tested drugs in the treatment of F. nucleatum infection."

2019-10-13	"Fusobacterium nucleatum Facilitates Apoptosis, ROS Generation, and Inflammatory Cytokine Production by Activating AKT/MAPK and NF-kappa B Signaling Pathways in Human Gingival Fibroblasts."	Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity	"Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) plays key roles in the initiation and progression of periodontitis. However, the pathogenic effect of F. nucleatum on human oral tissues and cells has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we aimed to analyze the pathogenic effects of F. nucleatum on human gingival fibroblasts (GFs) and clarify the potential mechanisms. RNA-sequencing analysis confirmed that F. nucleatum significantly altered the gene expression of GF as the stimulation time increased. Cell counting and EdU-labeling assays indicated that F. nucleatum inhibited GF proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, cell apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and proinflammatory cytokine production were dramatically elevated after F. nucleatum stimulation. Furthermore, we found that the AKT/MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways were significantly activated by F. nucleatum infection and that a large number of genes related to cellular proliferation, apoptosis, ROS, and inflammatory cytokine production downstream of AKT/MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways were significantly altered in F. nucleatum-stimulated GFs. These findings suggest that F. nucleatum inhibits GF proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis, ROS generation, and inflammatory cytokine production partly by activating the AKT/MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Our study opens a new window for understanding the pathogenic effects of periodontal pathogens on the host oral system."	"Kang, W., Jia, Z., Tang, D., Zhang, Z., Gao, H., He, K., & Feng, Q. (2019).

2020-01-21	Impacts of the plateau environment on the gut microbiota and blood clinical indexes in Han and Tibetan individuals	mSystems	"The intestinal microbiota is significantly affected by the external environment, but our understanding of the effects of extreme environments such as plateaus is far from adequate. In this study, we systematically analyzed the variation in the intestinal microbiota and 76 blood clinical indexes among 393 healthy adults with different plateau living durations (Han individuals with no plateau living, with plateau living for 4 to 6 days, with plateau living for >3 months, and who returned to the plain for 3 months, as well as plateau-living Tibetans). The results showed that the high-altitude environment rapidly (4 days) and continually (more than 3 months) shaped both the intestinal microbiota and clinical indexes of the Han population. With prolongation of plateau living, the general characteristics of the intestinal microbiota and clinical indexes of the Han population were increasingly similar to those of the Tibetan population. The intestinal microbiota of the Han population that returned to the plain area for 3 months still resembled that of the plateau-living Han population rather than that of the Han population on the plain. Moreover, clinical indexes such as blood glucose were significantly lower in the plateau groups than in the nonplateau groups, while the opposite result was obtained for testosterone. Interestingly, there were Tibetan-specific correlations between glucose levels and Succinivibrio and Sarcina abundance in the intestine. The results of this study suggest that a hypoxic environment could rapidly and lastingly affect both the human intestinal microbiota and blood clinical indexes, providing new insights for the study of plateau adaptability."

It is unclear how the human immune system responds to this infection. Here, we used metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight COVID-19 cases. The expression of proinflammatory genes, especially chemokines, was markedly elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to community-acquired pneumonia patients and healthy controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercytokinemia. Compared to SARS-CoV, which is thought to induce inadequate interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 robustly triggered expression of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs exhibit immunopathogenic potential, with overrepresentation of genes involved in inflammation. The transcriptome data was also used to estimate immune cell populations, revealing increases in activated dendritic cells and neutrophils. Collectively, these host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection could further our understanding of disease pathogenesis and point toward antiviral strategies."

2020-06-01	Transcriptome-based drug repositioning for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)	Pathogens and Disease	"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) around the world has led to a pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are no effective drugs to prevent and treat the disease. Transcriptome-based drug repositioning, identifying new indications for old drugs, is a powerful tool for drug development. Using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid transcriptome data of COVID-19 patients, we found that the endocytosis and lysosome pathways are highly involved in the disease and that the regulation of genes involved in neutrophil degranulation was disrupted, suggesting an intense battle between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. Furthermore, we implemented a coexpression drug repositioning analysis, cogena, and identified two antiviral drugs (saquinavir and ribavirin) and several other candidate drugs (such as dinoprost, dipivefrine, dexamethasone and (-)-isoprenaline). Notably, the two antiviral drugs have also previously been identified using molecular docking methods, and ribavirin is a recommended drug in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID pneumonia (trial version 5-7) published by the National Health Commission of the P.R. of China. Our study demonstrates the value of the cogena-based drug repositioning method for emerging infectious diseases, improves our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and provides potential drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia."
