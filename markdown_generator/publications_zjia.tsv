2013-01-01 	Application of ribosome profiling	Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics	"The ribosome profiling, based on deep sequencing of the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, makes it possible to deeply and precisely study genome-wide protein translation process and translation regulation. This review introduces the development, construction and analysis of the ribosome profiling, and focuses on its wide applications. These applications include discovering novel ORFs (such as uORF and sORF), deciphering the mechanism of microRNA functional roles, charactering the translation efficiency and differential translation, predicting the protein abundance and illustrating the mechanism of protein translation. Finally, we analyze the broad development prospect of ribosome profiling. http://www.pibb.ac.cn/pibbcn/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=20120395&flag=1"	"Jia, Z.L., Qu, W.B., Lu, Y.M., Luo, Z.G., & Zhang, C.G.

2015-09-08 	Gene Ranking of RNA-Seq Data via Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization	PLos One	"RNA-sequencing is rapidly becoming the method of choice for studying the full complexity of transcriptomes, however with increasing dimensionality, accurate gene ranking is becoming increasingly challenging. This paper proposes an accurate and sensitive gene ranking method that implements discriminant non-negative matrix factorization (DNMF) for RNA-seq data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the utility of DNMF for gene ranking. When incorporating Fisher's discriminant criteria and setting the reduced dimension as two, DNMF learns two factors to approximate the original gene expression data, abstracting the up-regulated or down-regulated metagene by using the sample label information. The first factor denotes all the genes' weights of two metagenes as the additive combination of all genes, while the second learned factor represents the expression values of two metagenes. In the gene ranking stage, all the genes are ranked as a descending sequence according to the differential values of the metagene weights. Leveraging the nature of NMF and Fisher's criterion, DNMF can robustly boost the gene ranking performance. The Area Under the Curve analysis of differential expression analysis on two benchmarking tests of four RNA-seq data sets with similar phenotypes showed that our proposed DNMF-based gene ranking method outperforms other widely used methods. Moreover, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also showed DNMF outweighs others. DNMF is also computationally efficient, substantially outperforming all other benchmarked methods. Consequently, we suggest DNMF is an effective method for the analysis of differential gene expression and gene ranking for RNA-seq data."
