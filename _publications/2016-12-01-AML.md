title: "High Expression of CPT1A Predicts Adverse Outcomes: A Potential Therapeutic Target for Acute Myeloid Leukemia"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-12-01-AML
excerpt: 'Identification of prognostic biomarkers is essential for therapeutic choice of AML. This study represents direct evidences that high expression of CPT1A is significantly associated with poor outcomes and abnormal genomic and epigenomic patterns in AML patients. CPT1A is an important catalyzer for fatty-acid oxidation pathway, which may provide alternative carbon source for leukemia proliferation. Findings of this study may indicate the significance of fat metabolism in leukemogenesis.'

Identification of prognostic biomarkers is essential for therapeutic choice of AML. This study represents direct evidences that high expression of CPT1A is significantly associated with poor outcomes and abnormal genomic and epigenomic patterns in AML patients. CPT1A is an important catalyzer for fatty-acid oxidation pathway, which may provide alternative carbon source for leukemia proliferation. Findings of this study may indicate the significance of fat metabolism in leukemogenesis.
