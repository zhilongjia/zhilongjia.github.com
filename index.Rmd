_Welcome to my personal homepage_

I am a PhD student researching Bioinformatics. My research interest is drug repositioning.

### Some Projects:

*  [Gene Ranking of RNA-Seq Data via Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (DNMF)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137782)
    + The *DNMF package* and *codes* to reproduce the results in this article are availiable at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DNMF/index.html) and [github]((https://github.com/zhilongjia/geneRanking)) as well.
    + One article related with it was published in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137782).

* [Drug repositioning based on co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis, cogena](https://github.com/zhilongjia/cogena)
    + A vignette about cogena can be found at <http://zhilongjia.github.io/cogena/>.
